Comment:
 Below are some of the accompanying statements that Openbve and the
 upstream developers have made regarding how the work can be used,
 this provides greater insight and context into the wishes of upstream,
 beyond the simple and permissive "public domain" wording.
 .
 It's notable that the intent and appreciation for sharing and
 openness has always present with upstream, as can be seen from the
 name "Open...".  Openbve was itself a reaction to "freeware" but
 non-distributable, and non-fixable programm "BVE Trainsim"
 (originally called "Boso View Express", 鉄道運転シミュレーション).
 .
 Although the intent has been constant, the PD wording has evolved,
 attempting to remain short.  Upstream have welcomed input where it
 as been offered on the licence-terminology; as can be seen in the
 discussion: the upstream preference would be for copyright law to
 not exist (international treaties dictate otherwise for the moment).
 .
 History
 .
 In 2008, in preparation for Debian packaging, discussion was started
 with upstream via the upstream bugtracker/forum, and is copied below
 for context.  (At the time it was the best introduction to the
 licence and original intent behind the Openbve project).
 .
 More information on the thinking behind the "licence-free" intend has been
 saved here in this 'debian/copyright' file, the essence of which is:

   I have been approached by some individuals over the time, including
   from the GNU project and the Ubuntu Foundation (as it appears at
   least), and was told that they lack a means of "legal security" for
   reuse without an explicit license. You can read my above post on
   details about my attitude regarding this matter, but as a start, I
   have decided to put the following line on the homepage and will also
   include it in any later release:

     " This program, along with all documentation provided, is dedicated

       can be used, and explicitly encourage redistribution and
       modification for any purpose. "

   Just out of curiosity, what licence applies to OpenBVE? It'd be nice
   to know if it's GPL or BSD or whatever as I'm quite interested in
   helping out.

   My attitude differs from so called "free software" licenses. I try to
   explain:
 .
   With proprietary software, the developers usually try to restrict what
   you are allowed to do with the software to the uttermost extreme that
   is legally possible. This falls under the category of copyright.
 .
   Then there is something that is sometimes called green copyright. So
   called free software falls in this category. As with proprietary
   software, a license is used to tell users what they are allowed to do
   and what not. The difference to proprietary software is that so called
   free software licenses are usually much more permissive, yet the
   author decides what you are allowed to do and what not. So called free
   software is usually attributed to derive from "freedom" instead of
   "free of charge". Still, if the author employs a license telling other
   people what they can or cannot do, this inherently cannot have
   anything to do with freedom.
 .
   Then there is something called public domain, which I consider to be
   an inherently good thing as everyone has eventually the same rights as
   the author. However, releasing a work into the public domain is not
   legally meaningful in many countries. Also, releasing a work into the
   public domain (if possible) depends on the generosity of the author,
   and this decision is made by the author.
 .
   My attitude is even one step further: I am opposed to copyright, thus
   I marked the game with the legally not meaningful phrase of
   "anti-copyright". It is legally meaningless, because in every country
   that has some form of copyright, it would require these laws to be
   abandoned. Still, why do I have this attitude?
 .
   With a license, I would be telling other people what they can or
   cannot do. I am not such a person. I will not make any silly
   restrictions on how you can use this program, I will not tell you to
   put my name on any derived work, I will never ever give "permission"
   for you modify or redistribute the software, because I don't think
   that it is up to me telling you what you can or can't do. You should
   make this decision for yourself.
 .
   I hope this briefly explained the situation.

   Way to go Michelle!

   Good to hear from another lonely soul out there who gets the true
   meaning of freedom.
